The bibliographic references may reside in a Zotero group library, where multiple users may collaborate to manage the content, or in a Zotero private library. On the web server, Kerko maintains a search index, which is a copy of the Zotero library that is optimized for search. When users interact with the web application, Kerko gets all the required data from that search index, without ever contacting zotero.org. It is through a scheduled task, which runs at regular intervals, that Kerko automatically brings its search index up to date by using the Zotero Web API to retrieve the latest data from zotero.org.</p> <p>Kerko is implemented in Python using the Flask framework. As an application component, Kerko only works when incorporated into a Flask application. Such an application, KerkoApp, is available for you to use, and can be deployed on a web server. KerkoApp can be seen as just a thin layer over Kerko. It might work for you if you like the default appearance, and if the provided configuration options are sufficient for your needs.</p> <p>For more advanced needs, you could consider building a custom application, possibly derived from KerkoApp, where additional customizations could be implemented in Python. In this scenario, it is not recommended that you change Kerko itself, but that you use Kerko's Python API to implement your customizations. Kerko is actually a Flask \"blueprint\" (similar to what some other systems might call a plugin or an extension), which allows a modular architecture where the application integrates and extends Kerko, and possibly other blueprints as well; the Kerko-powered bibliography could be just one component of a larger Flask application.</p>"},{"location":"#demo-site","title":"Demo site","text":"<p>A demo site, which is based on KerkoApp, is available for you to try. You may also view the Zotero library that contains the source data for the demo site.</p>"},{"location":"#sites-using-kerko","title":"Sites using Kerko","text":"<p>The following sites are powered by Kerko:</p> <ul> <li>Bibliographie francophone sur l'archivistique</li> <li>Community Knowledge Open Library on English-Speaking Quebec</li> <li>Lipedema Foundation LEGATO Lipedema Library</li> <li>Open Development &amp; Education Evidence Library</li> <li>The EdTech Hub Evidence Library</li> <li>University of Saint Joseph Research Output</li> </ul> <p>Are you using Kerko?</p> <p>If you would like to add your Kerko-powered site to this list, please e-mail us or submit a pull request.</p>"},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<p>The main features provided by Kerko are:</p> <ul> <li>Faceted search interface: allows exploration of the bibliography both in   search mode and in browsing mode, potentially suiting different user needs,   behaviors, and abilities. For example, users with a prior idea of the topic or   expected results may enter keywords or a more complex query in a search field,   while those who wish to become familiar with the content of the bibliography   or discover new topics may choose to navigate along the proposed facets, to   narrow or broaden their search. Since both modes are integrated into a single   interface, it is possible to combine them.</li> <li>Keyword search features:<ul> <li>Boolean operators:<ul> <li><code>AND</code>: matches items that contain all specified terms. This is the default relation between terms when no operator is specified, e.g., <code>a b</code> is the same as <code>a AND b</code>.</li> <li><code>OR</code>: matches items that contain any of the specified terms, e.g., <code>a OR b</code>.</li> <li><code>NOT</code>: excludes items that match the term, e.g., <code>NOT a</code>.</li> <li>Boolean operators must be specified in uppercase and may be translated in other languages.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Logical grouping (with parentheses), e.g., <code>(a OR b) AND c</code>.</li> <li>Sequence of words (with double quotes), e.g., <code>\"a b c\"</code>. The default     difference between word positions is 1, meaning that an item will match if     it contains the words next to each other, but a different maximum distance     may be selected (with the tilde character), e.g. <code>\"web search\"~2</code> allows up     to 1 word between <code>web</code> and <code>search</code>, meaning it could match <code>web site     search</code> as well as <code>web search</code>.</li> <li>Term boosting (with the caret), e.g., <code>faceted^2 search browsing^0.5</code>     specifies that <code>faceted</code> is twice as important as <code>search</code> when computing     the relevance score of results, while <code>browsing</code> is half as important.     Boosting may be applied to a logical grouping, e.g., <code>(a b)^3 c</code>.</li> <li>Keyword search is case-insensitive, accents are folded, and punctuation is     ignored. To further improve recall (albeit at the cost of precision),     stemming is also performed on terms from most text fields, e.g., title,     abstract, notes. Stemming relieves the user from having to specify all     variants of a word when searching, e.g., terms such as <code>search</code>, <code>searches</code>,     and <code>searching</code> all return the same results. The Snowball algorithm is     used for that purpose.</li> <li>Full-text search: the text content of PDF attachments can be searched.</li> <li>Scope of search: users may choose to search everywhere, in     author/contributor names, in titles, in all fields (i.e., in metadata and     notes), or in documents (i.e., in the text content of attachments).     Applications may provide additional choices.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Faceted browsing: allows filtering by topic (Zotero tag), by resource type   (Zotero item type), by publication year. Moreover, you may define additional   facets modeled on collections and subcollections; in such case, any collection   can be represented as a facet, and each subcollection as a value within that   facet. By taking advantage of Zotero's ability to assign any given item to   multiple collections, a faceted classification scheme can be designed,   including hierarchical subdivisions within facets.</li> <li>Relevance scoring: provided by the Whoosh library and based on the   BM25F algorithm, which determines how important a term is to a document in   the context of the whole collection of documents, while taking into account   its relation to document structure (in this regard most fields are neutral,   but the score is boosted when a term appears in specific fields, e.g., DOI,   ISBN, ISSN, title, author/contributor). Any keyword search asks the question   \"how well does this document match this query clause?\", which requires   calculating a relevance score for each document. Filtering with facets, on the   other hand, has no effect on the score because it asks \"does this document   match this query clause?\", which leads to a yes or no answer.</li> <li>Sort options: by relevance score (only applicable to keyword search), by   publication date, by author, by title.</li> <li>Citation styles: any from the Zotero Style Repository, or   custom stylesheet defined in the Citation Style Language (stylesheet   must be accessible by URL).</li> <li>Language support: the default language of the user interface is English,   but some translations are provided. Additional   translations may be created using gettext-compatible tools (see Translating   Kerko). Also to consider: locales   supported by the Zotero Data Schema (which provides the names   of fields, item types and author types displayed by Kerko); languages   supported by Whoosh (which provides the search capabilities), i.e., ar, da,   nl, en, fi, fr, de, hu, it, no, pt, ro, ru, es, sv, tr.</li> <li>Semantic markup: pages generated by Kerko embed HTML markup that can be   detected by web crawlers (helping the indexing of your records by search   engines) or by web browsers (allowing users of reference management tools to   easily import metadata in their library). Supported schemes are:<ul> <li>OpenURL COinS, in search results pages and individual   bibliographic record pages. COinS is recognized by many reference   management tools, including the Zotero   Connector browser extension.</li> <li>Highwire Press tags, in the individual bibliographic record pages of book,   conference paper, journal article, report or thesis items. These tags are   recommended for indexing by Google Scholar, and   are recognized by many other databases and reference management tools,   including the Zotero Connector browser extension.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Web feeds: users of news aggregators or feed readers may get updates when   new bibliographic records are added. They may subscribe to the main feed, or   to one or more custom feeds.<ul> <li>The main feed lists the most recently added bibliographic records.</li> <li>Any search page has a related custom feed that lists the most recently   added bibliographic records that match the search criteria. Thus, a user   can obtain a custom feed for a particular area of interest simply by   entering keywords to search and/or selecting filters.</li> <li>Feeds are provided in the Atom syndication format.</li> <li>Basic metadata is provided directly in the feeds, using both Atom and   unqualified Dublin Core elements.</li> <li>An age limit may be configured to exclude older items from the feeds. This   may be useful to bibliographies that are frequently updated and mostly   meant to promote recent literature (all resources still remain visible to   the search interface regardless of their age).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Sitemap: an XML Sitemap is automatically generated, and you   may use it to help search engines discover your bibliographic records.</li> <li>Exporting: users may export individual records as well as complete   bibliographies corresponding to search results. By default, download links are   provided for the RIS and BibTeX formats, but applications may be configured to   export any format supported by the Zotero API.</li> <li>Printing: stylesheets are provided for printing individual bibliographic   records as well as lists of search results. When printing search results, all   results get printed (not just the current page of results).</li> <li>Notes and attachments: notes, attached files, and attached links to URIs   are synchronized from zotero.org and made available to users of the   bibliography. Regular expressions may be used to include or exclude such child   items from the bibliography, based on their tags.</li> <li>DOI, ISBN and ISSN resolver: items that have such identifier in your   library can be referenced by appending their identifier to your Kerko site's   base URL.</li> <li>Relations: bibliographic record pages show links to related items, if any.   You may define such relations using Zotero's Related field. Moreover, Kerko   adds the Cites and Cited by relation types, which can be managed in Zotero   through notes (see    guide). Custom   applications can add more types of relations if desired.</li> <li>Pages: simple informational pages can be defined using content from Zotero   standalone notes.</li> <li>Badges: custom applications can have icons conditionally displayed next to   items.</li> <li>Responsive design: the simple default implementation works on large   monitors as well as on small screens. It is based on Bootstrap.</li> <li>Google Analytics integration: just provide a Google Analytics stream ID to   have Kerko automatically include the tracking code into its pages.</li> <li>Integration: as a Flask blueprint, Kerko can be   integrated into any Flask application. For a standalone application, however,   you may simply install   KerkoApp.</li> <li>Customizable front-end: applications may partly or fully replace the   default templates, scripts and stylesheets with their own.</li> <li>Command line interface (CLI): Kerko provides commands for synchronizing or   deleting its data.</li> </ul> <p>KerkoApp is a standalone application built around Kerko. It inherits all of Kerko's features and it provides a few additions of its own:</p> <ul> <li>Configuration files: allow separation of configuration from code and   enable the Twelve-factor App methodology. Environment   variables and TOML configuration files are supported. Secrets,   server-specific parameters, and general parameters can be configured in   separate files.</li> <li>Page templates for common HTTP errors.</li> <li>Syslog logging handler (for Unix environments).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>Kerko requires Python 3.8 or later.</p> <p>Required Python packages will be automatically installed when installing Kerko.

Other features, even when they are common to many web sites, do not belong to   Kerko and should be left to the applications to implement.</li> <li>Use a lightweight framework to avoid carrying many features that are not   needed by Kerko (Flask was selected for this reason).</li> <li>Use pure Python dependencies to keep installation and deployment simple (Hence   the use of Whoosh for search, for example, instead of Elasticsearch or Solr).</li> <li>Use a classic server-side rendering architecture.

This can be disabled by setting   <code>KERKO_FULLTEXT_SEARCH</code> to <code>False</code>. Since this feature relies on Zotero's   full-text indexing, you must make sure that it works in Zotero first; see   Zotero's   documentation.</li> <li>Add new search scopes \"Everywhere\" (to search both metadata fields and the   text content of attached documents) and \"In documents\" (to search the text   content of attached documents).

Kerko filters them out of search results, but custom applications could search   them.

Instead of performing a full synchronization each time, Kerko now   retrieves just the newly added or updated items. This dramatically reduces the   number of Zotero API calls (and time) required to update Kerko's search index.   Note: More work is planned to eliminate some Zotero API calls that Kerko   still makes early in the synchronization process and that could be avoided   when its cache is already up-to-date.</li> <li>Add a <code>sync cache</code> command to the command line interface.</li> <li>On narrow screens, stack search form controls for better usability.</li> <li>Respond with an HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) when the search index is empty   or unreadable.</li> <li>Make sorts more efficient by setting the <code>sortable</code> Whoosh flag on relevant   fields.</li> <li>Leading and trailing underscore characters (<code>_</code>) are now trimmed from facet   value labels. This happens after sorting the values, which means that the   underscore can still be used as a prefix to alter the alphabetical order.</li> <li>Support more timezone names. Timezone names such as 'US/Eastern' or   'Europe/London' previously did not work, and times could not be converted   to daylight saving times.</li> <li>Change labels:<ul> <li>\"Print this citation\" \u2192 \"Print this record\" (on item pages)</li> <li>\"Download this citation\" \u2192 \"Download this record\" (on item &amp; search pages)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Inject blocks in item Jinja2 template to facilitate theming.</li> <li>Slightly increase some top/bottom margins.</li> <li>Add the <code>type</code> HTML attribute to record download links.</li> <li>Add the <code>rel=\"alternate\"</code> HTML attribute to record download links on item   pages. Also add a corresponding <code>link</code> element to the page <code>head</code>.</li> <li>Added utilities for running automated integration tests.

With this scheme, a collection in the Zotero library represents a facet, and its subcollections correspond to values (or user-selectable filters) within the facet. Figure 1 below illustrates such mapping, taken from the demo library and its corresponding demo site.</p> <p></p> Figure 1. Side-by-side comparison between the structure of collections in a Zotero library and the resulting faceted browsing interface in Kerko. <p>For such mapping to work, the following conditions must be met:</p> <ul> <li>The collection that is to be mapped to a facet must be a top-level   collection. In other words, it must be directly under the root of your   Zotero library.</li> <li>At least one subcollection must be present within the chosen top-level   collection, and that subcollection (or one of its own subcollections) must   contain at least one item.</li> </ul> <p>Once your Zotero library it set up to meet those conditions, you may configure the facets. For the example in Figure 1, the configuration looks like this:</p> <pre><code>[kerko.facets.topic]\nenabled = true\ntype = \"collection\"\ncollection_key = \"KY3BNA6T\"\nfilter_key = \"topic\"\ntitle = \"Topic\"\nweight = 110\ninitial_limit = 5\ninitial_limit_leeway = 2\n\n[kerko.facets.field_of_study]\nenabled = true\ntype = \"collection\"\ncollection_key = \"7H2Q7L6I\"\nfilter_key = \"field-of-study\"\ntitle = \"Field of study\"\nweight = 120\ninitial_limit = 5\ninitial_limit_leeway = 2\n\n[kerko.facets.contribution]\nenabled = true\ntype = \"collection\"\ncollection_key = \"JFQRH4X2\"\nfilter_key = \"contribution\"\ntitle = \"Contribution\"\nweight = 130\ninitial_limit = 5\ninitial_limit_leeway = 2\n</code></pre> <p>For details on each parameter, please refer to the parameters documentation. However, we can highlight some elements:</p> <ul> <li><code>collection_key</code> is the key assigned by Zotero to identify the collection. An   easy way to find this key is to visit your library using Zotero's web   interface. Click the collection, and check its URL in your browser's address   bar. In our example, the URL of the \"Topic\" collection is   https://www.zotero.org/groups/2348869/kerko_demo/collections/KY3BNA6T,   hence the use of <code>\"KY3BNA6T\"</code> as the collection key.</li> <li><code>filter_key</code> tells Kerko the key to use in URLs when a user of your Kerko site   selects a filter within the facet. In our example, for the \"Topic\" facet we   chose to set this parameter to <code>\"topic\"</code> and, consequently, the search URL   will look like   https://demo.kerko.whiskyechobravo.com/bibliography/?topic=Z8LT6QZG.2ZGZH2E2.</li> <li><code>title</code> is the heading that Kerko will show for the facet. If desired, you may   choose a title that is different from the collection's name in Zotero.</li> <li><code>weight</code> determines the relative position of the facet. Small numbers (low   weights) rise above large ones (heavier weights). This explains why, in our   example, Kerko displays \"Topic\" (weighting 110) above \"Field of study\" (120)   and \"Contribution\" (130).</li> </ul> <p>Other things to know:</p> <ul> <li> <p>After adding a new facet, you must clean and re-sync the search index. Please   check the documentation on synchronization, but in short   you have to use the following commands:</p> <pre><code>flask kerko clean index\nflask kerko sync index\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Kerko allows a facet to have any number of hierarchical sublevels (nested   subcollections).</p> </li> <li>Any new subcollection will automatically appear under the facet after a sync,   if it (or one of its own subcollections) contains at least one item.   Collection structures that contain no items will not show up in Kerko.</li> <li>An item may belong to multiple collections in Zotero. Take advantage of that   capability when designing your faceted classification. Ideally, facets   complement each other in describing different perspectives on the same   objects. If you are unfamiliar with faceted classification, we highly   recommend this paper by William Denton (2003): How to Make a Faceted   Classification and Put It On the   Web.</li> <li>In Zotero, an item only needs to be assigned to the hierarchical level that is   most relevant for it. You do not need to also add the item to the parent   collections. The reason is that in Kerko a given filter automatically includes   the items from its corresponding subcollection and all of its subcollections.</li> <li>You do not have to expose all of your Zotero library's top-level collections   to Kerko. Kerko will only use those that are given in the configuration, and   ignore the others. Note, however, that unless you use item   inclusion or   exclusion parameters, items will be   visible in your Kerko site regardless of the collections they belong to.</li> </ul> <p>Phew! We think that this is simpler to setup in practice than it looks in writing.

Various conditions may cause an attachment to be partially indexed or unindexed, e.g., file is large, has not been processed yet, or does not contain text.</p> <p>Zotero shows the indexing status in the attachment's right pane. If it shows \"Indexed: Yes\", all is good. If it shows \"Indexed: No\" or \"Indexed: Partial\", then clicking the \"Reindex Item\" button (next to the indexing status) should ensure that the attachment gets fully indexed, that is if the file actually contains text. If there is no \"Reindex Item\" button, it probably means that Zotero does not support that file type for full-text indexing (at the moment, it only supports PDF and plain text files).</p> <p>It can be tedious to go through hundreds of attachments just to find out whether they are indexed or not. To make things easier, you could create a saved search in your Zotero library to get an always up-to-date list of unindexed PDFs.

This is where you will put secret keys that should only be known to your server. Its content should look like the following:</p> .secrets.toml<pre><code>SECRET_KEY = \"MY_SECRET_KEY\"\nZOTERO_API_KEY = \"MY_ZOTERO_API_KEY\"\n</code></pre> <p>You must set <code>SECRET_KEY</code> with a random string, and <code>ZOTERO_API_KEY</code> with an appropriate value (see configuration parameters).</p> <p>Then create the <code>~/instance.toml</code> file. This file will contain settings that are specific to your server, but are not secret. Its content should look like the following:</p> instance.toml<pre><code>LOGGING_HANDLER = \"syslog\"\n\n[kerkoapp.proxy_fix]\nenabled = true\nx_for = 1\nx_proto = 1\nx_host = 1\nx_port = 0\nx_prefix = 0\n</code></pre> <p>We are enabling the <code>kerkoapp.proxy_fix</code> parameters because we will configure nginx as a reverse proxy.</p> <p>Then create the <code>~/config.toml</code> file. This file will contain general settings for Kerko. You might have already tested KerkoApp on your desktop computer and created such file. If so, you could just copy that file to your server. At the very least it should contain the following settings:</p> config.toml<pre><code>ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID = \"MY_ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID\"\nZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE = \"MY_ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE\"\n\n[kerko.meta]\ntitle = \"My Bibliography\"\n</code></pre> <p>You must set <code>ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID</code> and <code>ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE</code> with appropriate values (see configuration parameters) so that Kerko can connect to your Zotero library.</p> <p>It is not absolutely necessary to use three separate configuration files for KerkoApp as we just did. You could, for example, have just <code>~/instance.toml</code> and put all of the settings there. However, it is a good practice to split the configuration, and that allows you to copy <code>config.toml</code> from or to other machines, or even share it with other people, without worrying about leaking secret keys or messing up your server-specific settings.</p> <p>Once the configuration files are ready, Kerko should be able to talk to Zotero. Have Kerko retrieve your Zotero library's data by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>flask --debug kerko sync\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>--debug</code> switch is optional. If you use it, some messages will give you an better idea of the progress of the sync process. If you omit it, the command will run silently unless there are warnings or errors.</p> <p>Depending on the size of your library, this process can complete within less than a minute or take an hour or more. Zotero throttles API requests to prevent its servers from getting overloaded, so sometimes the process might seem to freeze, but be patient and Kerko will resume synchronization a few minutes later.</p> <p>Now that synchronization works, configure the cron task that will synchronize data from your Zotero library on a regular basis. Run the following command (always from the <code>kerkoapp</code> user):</p> <pre><code>crontab -e\n</code></pre> <p>That will launch the default <code>nano</code> editor. Add the following line at the very bottom, then save the file and exit the editor:</p> crontab<pre><code>10 4 * * * cd /home/kerkoapp/kerkoapp &amp;&amp; /home/kerkoapp/venv/bin/flask kerko sync\n</code></pre> <p>That will synchronize the data once a day, at 4:10am.
