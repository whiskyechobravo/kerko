# Configuration reference

## Configuration overview

### Types of settings

There are two styles of configuration settings:

- Uppercase-name settings.
- Structured settings.

#### Uppercase-name settings

Kerko has a few such settings, but most are defined by Flask or by Flask
extensions. Examples names are: `SECRET_KEY`, `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`, `DATA_DIR`,
`BABEL_DEFAULT_LOCALE`. Flask stores those settings in a flat dictionary.

With KerkoApp, there are multiple ways to set those variables:

- As environment variables. ==:warning: In the environment, the name of the
  variable must be prefixed with "KERKOAPP_"==, e.g., `KERKOAPP_SECRET_KEY`,
  `KERKOAPP_ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`, `KERKOAPP_DATA_DIR`,
  `KERKOAPP_BABEL_DEFAULT_LOCALE`.
- As entries in a `.env` file. ==:warning: In the file, the name of the variable
  must be prefixed with "KERKOAPP_"==.
- As entries in a `.flaskenv` file. ==:warning: In the file, the name of the
  variable must be prefixed with "KERKOAPP_"==.
- As entries at the top of a TOML configuration file, without any extra prefix.

The above list is in descending order of precedence. This means that an
uppercase variable set in a TOML file can be overridden in `.flaskenv`, which
can be overridden in `.env`, which can finally be overridden in the environment.
Of course, we do not recommend setting the same variable in so many different
places, as that would surely lead to confusion!

In a custom application, uppercase settings may be assigned in Python directly
into the `config` attribute of the `Flask` object, without any extra prefix (see
[Configuration
handling](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/config/#configuration-handling),
in the Flask documentation). Such assignments must be done during the
initialization process. The application cannot change a setting while responding
to a request.


#### Structured settings

Most configuration options provided by Kerko follow this style where settings
have a lowercase name, are organized into a hierarchy, and are referenced using
dot-separated paths. Examples are: `kerko.features.results_abstracts`,
`kerko.meta.title`, `kerko.facets.item_type.enabled`.

With KerkoApp, those variables may be set in a [TOML] configuration file. The
TOML syntax allows organizing settings under headers to avoid repetitions and
to make the file more readable. Therefore, the `kerko.meta.title` setting, for
example, may appear in the configuration file as:

```toml
[kerko.meta]
title = "My Awesome Bibliography"
```

In this manual, however, we will always refer to a configuration setting using
its full dot-separated path, e.g., `kerko.meta.title`.

In a custom application, structured settings may be set in Python using the API
provided by Kerko, e.g.:

```python
from kerko.config_helpers import config_set
config_set(app.config, 'kerko.meta.title', 'My App')
```

Such assignments must be done during the initialization process. The application
cannot change a setting while responding to a request.


### File locations

The application uses different strategies for locating different types of
configuration files.

#### Location of `.env` and `.flaskenv` files

The `.env` or `.flaskenv` file is typically located in the application's root
directory, i.e., where the `wsgi.py` file is found, but Flask actually tries to
locate them by scanning directories upwards from the directory you call `flask`
from (see [Flask's CLI
documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/cli/#environment-variables-from-dotenv)).

#### Location of TOML configuration files

By default, KerkoApp will look for a `config.toml` file located in the
application's root directory, i.e., where the `wsgi.py` file is found.

You may tell KerkoApp to load one or more TOML files from arbitrary locations by
setting the `KERKOAPP_CONFIG_FILES` variable, either in the environment, in
`.env`, or in `.flaskenv`. The value must be a semicolon-separated list of
paths, where individual paths may be either absolute or relative to the
application's root directory. For example:

```bash
KERKOAPP_CONFIG_FILES="first_config.toml;/path/to/second_config.toml"
```

When multiple paths are specified in `KERKOAPP_CONFIG_FILES`, each new file in
the sequence will be merged into the known configuration. When a file contains
a setting that was already set by a previous file, it overrides the previous
value. This ability to specify multiple configuration files may be used to
separate, say, common settings from settings that are specific to development or
production instances.


### Best practices

We encourage KerkoApp users to follow the following practices:

- Put secret values and deployment-specific settings in a `.env` file.
- Put other settings, uppercase-name settings and structured settings, in a TOML
  configuration file.
- Do *not* push the `.env` file to a source code repository. Its content should
  remain private to the server where the application is deployed.
- Do include the TOML file in your code repository.


## Settings reference

This section describes most configuration settings available to Kerko and
KerkoApp.

Unless indicated otherwise, all settings are optional and will take a default
value if omitted from your configuration.

!!! note

    Flask and Flask extensions loaded by the application may provide additional
    configuration settings that are not described in this manual. To find those,
    please refer to the documentation of the relevant package.

!!! warning "Changing settings can be disruptive"

    Many of the configuration variables cause changes to the structure of
    Kerko's cache or search index. Changing those variables may require that you
    rebuild the cache or the search index, and restart the application. See
    [Useful commands](sync.md#useful-commands) for the cleaning and
    synchronization.

### Uppercase-name settings

!!! warning "Prefix your variables!"

    KerkoApp users must prefix uppercase-name settings with `KERKOAPP_` when
    setting a value in the environment, in a `.env` file, or in `.flaskenv`
    file. However, no prefix should be used when setting a value in a TOML
    configuration file.

`BABEL_DEFAULT_LOCALE`

: The default language of the user interface. Defaults
  to `'en'`. Your application may set this variable and/or implement a locale
  selector function to override it (see the [Flask-Babel
  documentation][Flask-Babel_documentation]).

`BABEL_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`

: The timezone to use for user facing dates.
  Defaults to `'UTC'`. Your application may set this variable and/or implement
  a timezone selector function to override it (see the [Flask-Babel
  documentation][Flask-Babel_documentation]). Any timezone name supported by
  the [pytz] package should work.

`CONFIG_FILES`

: This KerkoApp-specific variable specifies where to look for one or more TOML
  configuration files. The value must be a semicolon-separated list of paths,
  where individual paths may be either absolute or relative to the application's
  root directory.

    When multiple paths are specified, each new file in the sequence will be
    merged into the known configuration. When a file contains a setting that was
    already set by a previous file, it overrides the previous value.

    :warning: This variable cannot be set in a TOML file.

`DATA_DIR`

: The directory where Kerko will store its data (such as the search index and
  the file attachments). This may be specified as an absolute path or as a
  relative path. In the latter case, the path will be relative to the
  application's instance directory that is [determined by
  Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/#instance-folders).
  Default value is `data/kerko` (or `data\kerko` on Windows).

`SECRET_KEY`

: This setting is required for generating secure tokens in web forms. It should
  have a hard to guess, random value, and should really remain secret.
  :asterisk: **This setting is required and has no default value.**

`ZOTERO_API_KEY`

: Your Zotero API key, as [created on
  zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new). We recommend that you
  create a read-only API key, as Kerko does not need to write to your library.
  :asterisk: **This setting is required and has no default value.**

`ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`

: The identifier of the Zotero library to get data from. For a personal library
  this value is your   _userID_, as found on
  https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys (you must be logged-in). For a group
  library this value is the _groupID_ of the library, as found in the URL of the
  library (e.g., the _groupID_ of the library at
  https://www.zotero.org/groups/2348869/kerko_demo is `2348869`).
  :asterisk: **This setting is required and has no default value.**

`ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE`

: The type of library to get data from, either `'user'` for a personal library,
  or `'group'` for a group library.
  :asterisk: **This setting is required and has no default value.**

### Structured settings: kerko.features

`kerko.features.download_attachment_new_window`

: Open attachments in new windows, i.e.,
  add the `target="_blank"` attribute to attachment links. DefaultsÂ to `False`.

`kerko.features.download_citations_link`

: Provide a record download button on search
  results pages. Defaults to `True`.

`kerko.features.download_citations_max_count`

: Limit over which the record download
  button should be hidden from search results pages. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no
  limit).

`kerko.features.open_in_zotero_app`

: On item pages, show a button for opening the
  corresponding item in the Zotero application (through a link using the
  `zotero://` protocol). If this option is set to `True`, a user will still need
  to first enable the button from the Preferences menu (which can be accessed
  from the footer of item pages and saves the user's choices in browser
  cookies). For the link to work, the user must also have the Zotero application
  installed, and have access to the Zotero library. This feature is generally
  only useful to library editors and might confuse other users, especially if
  your Zotero library is private. Thus you should probably enable this option
  only if there is a strong need from the editors. Defaults to `False`.

`kerko.features.open_in_zotero_web`

: On item pages, show a button for viewing the
  corresponding item on zotero.org (through a regular hyperlink). If this option
  is set to `True`, a user will still need to first enable the button from the
  Preferences menu (which can be accessed from the footer of item pages and
  saves the user's choices in browser cookies). For the link to work, the user
  must also have access to the Zotero library. This feature is generally only
  useful to library editors and might confuse other users, especially if your
  Zotero library is private. Thus you should probably enable this option only if
  there is a strong need from the editors. Defaults to `False`.

`kerko.features.print_item_link`

: Provide a print button on item pages. Defaults to `False`.

`kerko.features.print_citations_link`

: Provide a print button on search results pages. Defaults to `False`.

`kerko.features.print_citations_max_count`

: Limit over which the print button should
  be hidden from search results pages. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no limit).

`kerko.features.relations_initial_limit`

: Number of related items to show above the "show more" link. Defaults to `5`.

`kerko.features.relations_links`

: Show item links in lists of related items. Defaults
  to `False`. Enabling this only has an effect if at least one of the following
  variables is also set to `True`: `kerko.features.results_attachment_links`,
  `kerko.features.results_url_links`.

`kerko.features.results_abstracts`

: Show abstracts on search result pages. Defaults to `False` (abstracts are hidden).

`kerko.features.results_abstracts_toggler`

: Show a button letting users show or hide
  abstracts on search results pages. Defaults to `True` (toggle is displayed).

`kerko.features.results_abstracts_max_length`

: Truncate abstracts at the given length
  (in number of characters). If text is to be truncated in the middle of a word,
  the whole word is discarded instead. Truncated text is appended with an
  ellipsis sign ("..."). Defaults to `0` (abstracts get displayed in their full
  length, without any truncation).

`kerko.features.results_abstracts_max_length_leeway`

: If the length of an abstract only
  exceeds `kerko.features.results_abstracts_max_length` by this tolerance margin or less
  (in number of characters), it will not be truncated. Defaults to `0` (no
  tolerance margin).

`kerko.features.results_attachment_links`

: Provide links to attachments in search results. Defaults to `True`.

`kerko.features.results_url_links`

: Provide links to online resources in search
  results (for items whose URL field has a value). Defaults to `True`.

### Structured settings: kerko.feeds

`kerko.feeds.formats`

: A list of syndication feed formats to publish. Defaults to
  `['atom']`. If set to an empty list, no web feed will be provided. The only
  supported format is `'atom'`.

`kerko.feeds.fields`

: List of fields to retrieve for each feed item (these may
  be used by the `kerko.templates.atom_feed` template). Values in this list are
  keys identifying fields defined in the `kerko.composer.Composer` instance. One
  probably only needs to change the default list when overriding the template to
  display additional fields. Note that some fields from the default list may be
  required by other Kerko functions.

`kerko.feeds.max_days`

: The age (in number of days) of the oldest items
  allowed into web feeds. The Date field of the items are used for that purpose,
  and when no date is available, the date the item was added to Zotero is used
  instead. Defaults to `0` (no age limit). Unless your goal is to promote recent
  literature only, you should probably ignore this setting. Note: Items with
  missing dates will be considered as very recent, to prevent them from being
  excluded from feeds. For the same reason, items whose date lack the month
  and/or the day will be considered as from the 12th month of the year and/or
  the last day of the month.

### Structured settings: kerko.meta

`kerko.meta.google_analytics_id`

: A Google Analytics stream ID, e.g.,
  'G-??????????'. This variable is optional and is empty by default. If set and
  Flask is not running in debug mode, then the Google Analytics tag is inserted
  into the pages.

`kerko.meta.highwirepress_tags`

: Embed [Highwire Press
  tags](https://scholar.google.ca/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing) into
  the HTML of item pages. This should help search engines such as Google Scholar
  index your items, but works only with book, conference paper, journal article,
  report or thesis items. Defaults to `True` (i.e. enabled).

`kerko.meta.title`

: The title to display in web pages. Defaults to `'Kerko'`.

### Structured settings: kerko.pagination

`kerko.pagination.page_len`

: The number of search results per page. Defaults to `20`.

`kerko.pagination.pager_links`

: Number of pages to show in the pager (not counting the
  current page). Defaults to `4`.

### Structured settings: kerko.search

`kerko.search.fulltext`

: Allow full-text search of PDF attachments. Defaults
  to `True`. To get consistent results, see [Ensuring full-text indexing of your
  attachments in
  Zotero](#ensuring-full-text-indexing-of-your-attachments-in-zotero).

`kerko.search.result_fields`

: List of item fields to retrieve for search results
  (most notably used by the `kerko.templates.search_item` template). Values in
  this list are keys identifying fields defined in the `kerko.composer.Composer`
  instance. One probably only needs to change the default list when overriding
  the template to display additional fields. Note that some fields from the
  default list may be required by other Kerko functions.

`kerko.search.whoosh_language`

: The language of search requests. Defaults to
  `'en'`. You may refer to Whoosh's source to get the list of supported
  languages (`whoosh.lang.languages`) and the list of languages that support
  stemming (`whoosh.lang.has_stemmer()`).

### Structured settings: kerko.templates

`kerko.templates.search`

: Name of the Jinja2 template to render for the search
  page with list of results. Defaults to `kerko/search.html.jinja2`.

`kerko.templates.search_item`

: Name of the Jinja2 template to render for the
  search page with a single bibliographic record. Defaults to
  `kerko/search-item.html.jinja2`.

`kerko.templates.item`

: Name of the Jinja2 template to render for the
  bibliographic record view. Defaults to `kerko/item.html.jinja2`.

`kerko.templates.atom_feed`

: Name of the Jinja2 template used to render an Atom
  feed. Defaults to `kerko/atom.xml.jinja2`.

`kerko.templates.layout`

: Name of the Jinja2 template that is extended by the
  search, search-item, and item templates. Defaults to `kerko/layout.html.jinja2`.

`kerko.templates.base`

: Name of the Jinja2 template that is extended by the
  layout template. Defaults to `kerko/base.html.jinja2`.

### Structured settings: kerko.zotero

`kerko.zotero.csl_style`

: The citation style to use for formatted references. Can be
  either the file name (without the `.csl` extension) of one of the styles in the
  [Zotero Styles Repository][Zotero_styles] (e.g., `apa`) or the URL of a remote
  CSL file. Defaults to `'apa'`.

`kerko.zotero.batch_size`

: Number of items to request on each call to the
  Zotero API. Defaults to `100` (which is the maximum currently allowed by the
  API).

`kerko.zotero.locale`

: The locale to use with Zotero API calls. This
  dictates the locale of Zotero item types, field names, creator types and
  citations. Defaults to `'en-US'`. Supported locales are listed at
  https://api.zotero.org/schema, under "locales".

`kerko.zotero.max_attempts`

: Maximum number of tries after the Zotero API
  has returned an error or not responded during indexing. Defaults to `10`.

`kerko.zotero.wait`

: Time to wait (in seconds) between failed attempts to
  call the Zotero API. Defaults to `120`.

**TODO:docs: old KerkoApp stuff below, to update/integrate/remove**

- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_BADGES`: List of badges (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  badge will be created by default. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_badges()` for the list of default
  badges.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_CITATION_FORMATS`: List of record download formats
  (identified by key) to exclude from those created by default. If that list
  contains the value '*', no format will be created by default. Please refer to
  the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_citation_formats()` for the list of
  default formats.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_FACETS`: List of facets (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  facet will be created by default. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_facets()` for the list of default
  facets.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_FIELDS`: List of fields (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  field will be created by default. Caution: some default fields are required by
  Kerko or by badges. If required fields are excluded, the application will
  probably not start. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_fields()` for the list of default
  fields. Note that if `kerko.search.fulltext` is `False`, the `'text_docs'`
  field, which otherwise would contain the full-text, is excluded by default.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_SCOPES`: List of scopes (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  scope will be added by default. Caution: most default fields are expecting one
  or more of those scopes to exist. If required scopes are excluded, the
  application will probably not start. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_scopes()` for the list of default
  scopes. Note that if `kerko.search.fulltext` is `False`, the `'metadata'` ("In
  all fields") and `'fulltext'` ("In documents") scopes are excluded by default.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_SORTS`: List of sorts (identified by key) to exclude
  from those created by default. Caution: at least one sort must remain for the
  application to start. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_sorts()` for the list of default sorts.
- `KERKOAPP_FACET_INITIAL_LIMIT`: Limits the number of facet values initially
  shown on search results pages. If more values are available, a "show more"
  button will let the user expand the list. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no limit).
- `KERKOAPP_FACET_INITIAL_LIMIT_LEEWAY`: If the number of facet values exceeds
  `KERKOAPP_FACET_INITIAL_LIMIT` by this tolerance margin or less, all values
  will be initially shown. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no tolerance margin).
- `KERKOAPP_MIME_TYPES`: List of allowed MIME types for attachments. Defaults to
  `"application/pdf"`.
- `KERKOAPP_ITEM_EXCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to exclude items based on their tags.
  Any object that have a tag that matches this regular expression will be
  excluded. If empty (which is the default), no items will be excluded unless
  `KERKOAPP_ITEM_INCLUDE_RE` is set, in which case items that do not have any
  tag that matches it will be excluded.
- `KERKOAPP_ITEM_INCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to include items based on their tags.
  Any item which does not have a tag that matches this regular expression will
  be ignored. If this value is empty (which is the default), all items will be
  accepted unless `KERKOAPP_ITEM_EXCLUDE_RE` is set which can cause some items
  to be rejected.
- `KERKOAPP_TAG_EXCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to exclude tags. The default value
  causes any tag that begins with an underscore ('_') to be ignored by Kerko.
  Note that record exports (downloads) always include all tags regardless of
  this parameter, which only applies to information displayed by Kerko (exports
  are generated by the Zotero API, not by Kerko).
- `KERKOAPP_TAG_INCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to include tags. By default, all tags
  are accepted. Note that record exports (downloads) always include all tags
  regardless of this parameter, which only applies to information displayed by
  Kerko (exports are generated by the Zotero API, not by Kerko).
- `KERKOAPP_CHILD_EXCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to exclude children (e.g. notes,
  attachments) based on their tags. Any child that have a tag that matches this
  regular expression will be ignored. If empty, no children will be rejected
  unless `KERKOAPP_CHILD_INCLUDE_RE` is set and the tags of those children do
  not match it. By default, any child having at least one tag that begins with
  an underscore ('_') is rejected.
- `KERKOAPP_CHILD_INCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to include children (e.g. notes,
  attachments) based on their tags. Any child which does not have a tag that
  matches this regular expression will be ignored. If this value is empty (which
  is the default), all children will be accepted unless
  `KERKOAPP_CHILD_EXCLUDE_RE` is set and causes some to be rejected.
- `LOGGING_LEVEL`: Severity of events to track. Allowed values are `DEBUG`,
  `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Defaults to `DEBUG` if app is running
  in debug mode, and to `WARNING` otherwise.
