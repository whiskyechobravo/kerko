# Configuration reference

**TODO: some intro; decide on how to structure this (environment vars/TOML settings OR deployment-specific settings/app settings); mark required settings with a flag rather than structure the document based on that**

## Required settings

The variables below are required and have no default values:

- `SECRET_KEY`: This variable is required for generating secure tokens
  in web forms. It should have a hard to guess, random value, and should
  really remain secret.
- `ZOTERO_API_KEY`: Your API key, as [created on
  zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new).
- `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`: The identifier of the library to get data from. For
  your personal library this value should be your _userID_, as found on
  https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys (you must be logged-in). For a group
  library this value should be the _groupID_ of the library, as found in the URL
  of that library (e.g., in https://www.zotero.org/groups/2348869/kerko_demo,
  the _groupID_ is `2348869`).
- `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE`: The type of library to get data from, either `'user'`
  for your personal library, or `'group'` for a group library.


## Optional settings

**TODO:docs: make each setting stand out more; maybe convert to definition list (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/lists/#using-definition-lists)**

Any of the following variables may be added to your configuration if you wish to
override their default value:

**TODO:config: Clarify that the following may be set as environment variables or .env variables but with a prefix defined by the app (KERKOAPP_); or no prefix if set directly in app.config in Python code**

- `DATA_DIR`: The directory where Kerko will store its data (such as the search
  index and the file attachments). This may be specified as an absolute path or
  as a relative path. For the latter case, the path will be relative to the
  application's instance directory that is [determined by
  Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/#instance-folders).
  Under the data directory, subdirectories `cache`, `index` and `attachments`
  will be created if they do not already exist.

**TODO:config: below settings are specific to KerkoApp**

Any of the following variables may be added to your configuration if you wish to
override their default value:

- `KERKOAPP_CONFIG_FILES`: Semicolon-separated list of TOML configuration files.
  The configuration from each file will be merged into the known configuration.
  When file refers to a setting that was already set by a previous file, it
  overrides the previous value. This ability to specify multiple configuration
  files may be used to separate, say, common settings from settings that are
  specific to development and production instances (for example, a value for
  ``KERKOAPP_CONFIG_FILES` might look like
  `common_config.toml;prod_config.toml`). Individual paths may be either
  absolute or relative (to the application's root directory).
  **TODO:config: refine this description!**

**TODO: The following probably belongs more to the KerkoApp+Docker section**

The environment variable below is required to run KerkoApp with the provided
Docker image, and has no default value:

- `MODULE_NAME`: Specifies the Python module to be imported by Gunicorn.
  Normally set to `wsgi`, which causes Gunicorn to run with `APP_MODULE` set
  to `wsgi:app`.

**TODO:config: Clarify what those dots mean in the following structured/dict config**

- `kerko.zotero.csl_style`: The citation style to use for formatted references. Can be
  either the file name (without the `.csl` extension) of one of the styles in the
  [Zotero Styles Repository][Zotero_styles] (e.g., `apa`) or the URL of a remote
  CSL file. Defaults to `'apa'`.
- `kerko.features.download_attachment_new_window`: Open attachments in new windows, i.e.,
  add the `target="_blank"` attribute to attachment links. DefaultsÂ to `False`.
- `kerko.features.download_citations_link`: Provide a record download button on search
  results pages. Defaults to `True`.
- `kerko.features.download_citations_max_count`: Limit over which the record download
  button should be hidden from search results pages. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no
  limit).
- `kerko.feeds.formats`: A list of syndication feed formats to publish. Defaults to
  `['atom']`. If set to an empty list, no web feed will be provided. The only
  supported format is `'atom'`.
- `kerko.feeds.fields`: List of fields to retrieve for each feed item (these may
  be used by the `kerko.templates.atom_feed` template). Values in this list are
  keys identifying fields defined in the `kerko.composer.Composer` instance. One
  probably only needs to change the default list when overriding the template to
  display additional fields. Note that some fields from the default list may be
  required by other Kerko functions.
- `kerko.feeds.max_days`: The age (in number of days) of the oldest items
  allowed into web feeds. The Date field of the items are used for that purpose,
  and when no date is available, the date the item was added to Zotero is used
  instead. Defaults to `0` (no age limit). Unless your goal is to promote recent
  literature only, you should probably ignore this setting. Note: Items with
  missing dates will be considered as very recent, to prevent them from being
  excluded from feeds. For the same reason, items whose date lack the month
  and/or the day will be considered as from the 12th month of the year and/or
  the last day of the month.
- `kerko.fulltext`: Allow full-text search of PDF attachments. Defaults
  to `True`. To get consistent results, see [Ensuring full-text indexing of your
  attachments in
  Zotero](#ensuring-full-text-indexing-of-your-attachments-in-zotero).
- `kerko.meta.highwirepress_tags`: Embed [Highwire Press
  tags](https://scholar.google.ca/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing) into
  the HTML of item pages. This should help search engines such as Google Scholar
  index your items, but works only with book, conference paper, journal article,
  report or thesis items. Defaults to `True` (i.e. enabled).
- `kerko.pagination.page_len`: The number of search results per page. Defaults to `20`.
- `kerko.pagination.pager_links`: Number of pages to show in the pager (not counting the
  current page). Defaults to `4`.
- `kerko.features.print_item_link`: Provide a print button on item pages. Defaults to
  `False`.
- `kerko.features.print_citations_link`: Provide a print button on search results
  pages. Defaults to `False`.
- `kerko.features.print_citations_max_count`: Limit over which the print button should
  be hidden from search results pages. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no limit).
- `kerko.features.relations_initial_limit`: Number of related items to show above the
  "show more" link. Defaults to `5`.
- `kerko.features.relations_links`: Show item links in lists of related items. Defaults
  to `False`. Enabling this only has an effect if at least one of the following
  variables is also set to `True`: `kerko.features.results_attachment_links`,
  `kerko.features.results_url_links`.
- `kerko.features.results_abstracts`: Show abstracts on search result pages. Defaults to
  `False` (abstracts are hidden).
- `kerko.features.results_abstracts_toggler`: Show a button letting users show or hide
  abstracts on search results pages. Defaults to `True` (toggle is displayed).
- `kerko.features.results_abstracts_max_length`: Truncate abstracts at the given length
  (in number of characters). If text is to be truncated in the middle of a word,
  the whole word is discarded instead. Truncated text is appended with an
  ellipsis sign ("..."). Defaults to `0` (abstracts get displayed in their full
  length, without any truncation).
- `kerko.features.results_abstracts_max_length_leeway`: If the length of an abstract only
  exceeds `kerko.features.results_abstracts_max_length` by this tolerance margin or less
  (in number of characters), it will not be truncated. Defaults to `0` (no
  tolerance margin).
- `kerko.features.results_attachment_links`: Provide links to attachments in search
  results. Defaults to `True`.
- `kerko.features.results_url_links`: Provide links to online resources in search
  results (for items whose URL field has a value). Defaults to `True`.
- `kerko.search.result_fields`: List of item fields to retrieve for search results
  (most notably used by the `kerko.templates.search_item` template). Values in
  this list are keys identifying fields defined in the `kerko.composer.Composer`
  instance. One probably only needs to change the default list when overriding
  the template to display additional fields. Note that some fields from the
  default list may be required by other Kerko functions.
- `kerko.templates.search`: Name of the Jinja2 template to render for the search
  page with list of results. Defaults to `kerko/search.html.jinja2`.
- `kerko.templates.search_item`: Name of the Jinja2 template to render for the
  search page with a single bibliographic record. Defaults to
  `kerko/search-item.html.jinja2`.
- `kerko.templates.item`: Name of the Jinja2 template to render for the
  bibliographic record view. Defaults to `kerko/item.html.jinja2`.
- `kerko.templates.atom_feed`: Name of the Jinja2 template used to render an Atom
  feed. Defaults to `kerko/atom.xml.jinja2`.
- `kerko.templates.layout`: Name of the Jinja2 template that is extended by the
  search, search-item, and item templates. Defaults to `kerko/layout.html.jinja2`.
- `kerko.templates.base`: Name of the Jinja2 template that is extended by the
  layout template. Defaults to `kerko/base.html.jinja2`.
- `kerko.meta.title`: The title to display in web pages. Defaults to `'Kerko'`.
- `kerko.features.open_in_zotero_app`: On item pages, show a button for opening the
  corresponding item in the Zotero application (through a link using the
  `zotero://` protocol). If this option is set to `True`, a user will still need
  to first enable the button from the Preferences menu (which can be accessed
  from the footer of item pages and saves the user's choices in browser
  cookies). For the link to work, the user must also have the Zotero application
  installed, and have access to the Zotero library. This feature is generally
  only useful to library editors and might confuse other users, especially if
  your Zotero library is private. Thus you should probably enable this option
  only if there is a strong need from the editors. Defaults to `False`.
- `kerko.features.open_in_zotero_web`: On item pages, show a button for viewing the
  corresponding item on zotero.org (through a regular hyperlink). If this option
  is set to `True`, a user will still need to first enable the button from the
  Preferences menu (which can be accessed from the footer of item pages and
  saves the user's choices in browser cookies). For the link to work, the user
  must also have access to the Zotero library. This feature is generally only
  useful to library editors and might confuse other users, especially if your
  Zotero library is private. Thus you should probably enable this option only if
  there is a strong need from the editors. Defaults to `False`.
- `kerko.zotero.batch_size`: Number of items to request on each call to the
  Zotero API. Defaults to `100` (which is the maximum currently allowed by the
  API).
- `kerko.zotero.max_attempts`: Maximum number of tries after the Zotero API
  has returned an error or not responded during indexing. Defaults to `10`.
- `kerko.zotero.wait`: Time to wait (in seconds) between failed attempts to
  call the Zotero API. Defaults to `120`.
- Localization-related variables:
  - `BABEL_DEFAULT_LOCALE`: The default language of the user interface. Defaults
    to `'en'`. Your application may set this variable and/or implement a locale
    selector function to override it (see the [Flask-Babel
    documentation][Flask-Babel_documentation]).
  - `BABEL_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`: The timezone to use for user facing dates.
    Defaults to `'UTC'`. Your application may set this variable and/or implement
    a timezone selector function to override it (see the [Flask-Babel
    documentation][Flask-Babel_documentation]). Any timezone name supported by
    the [pytz] package should work.
  - `kerko.search.whoosh_language`: The language of search requests. Defaults to
    `'en'`. You may refer to Whoosh's source to get the list of supported
    languages (`whoosh.lang.languages`) and the list of languages that support
    stemming (`whoosh.lang.has_stemmer()`).
  - `kerko.zotero.locale`: The locale to use with Zotero API calls. This
    dictates the locale of Zotero item types, field names, creator types and
    citations. Defaults to `'en-US'`. Supported locales are listed at
    https://api.zotero.org/schema, under "locales".
- `kerko.meta.google_analytics_id`: A Google Analytics stream ID, e.g.,
  'G-??????????'. This variable is optional and is empty by default. If set and
  Flask is not running in debug mode, then the Google Analytics tag is inserted
  into the pages.

**Caution:** Many of the configuration variables cause changes to the structure
of Kerko's cache or search index. Changing those variables may require that you
rebuild the cache or the search index, and restart the application. See the
[command line interface](#command-line-interface-cli) for the cleaning and
synchronization commands.


**TODO:config: old KerkoApp stuff below, to update/integrate/remove**

- `KERKOAPP_COLLECTION_FACETS`: Defines facets modeled on Zotero collections.
  This variable should be a list of semicolon-delimited triples (collection key,
  facet weight and facet title, separated by colons). Each specified collection
  will appear in Kerko as a facet where subcollections will be represented as
  values within the facet. The weight determines a facet's position relative to
  the other facets. The facet title will be displayed by Kerko and, if desired,
  may be different from the collection's name in Zotero (you could use this to
  differentiate the names of collections made publicly available in Kerko
  through facets from those used internally in your Zotero library). Note that
  for a collection-based facet to appear in the search interface, all of the
  following conditions must be met:
  - The specified collection key corresponds to a top-level collection in the
    Zotero library.
  - The specified collection has at least one subcollection that contains at
    least one item that is not excluded by Kerko (meaning the item is not
    excluded by other settings such as `KERKOAPP_ITEM_EXCLUDE_RE` or
    `KERKOAPP_ITEM_INCLUDE_RE`).
  - The value of `KERKOAPP_COLLECTION_FACETS` should be defined within a single
    string, on a single line.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_BADGES`: List of badges (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  badge will be created by default. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_badges()` for the list of default
  badges.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_CITATION_FORMATS`: List of record download formats
  (identified by key) to exclude from those created by default. If that list
  contains the value '*', no format will be created by default. Please refer to
  the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_citation_formats()` for the list of
  default formats.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_FACETS`: List of facets (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  facet will be created by default. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_facets()` for the list of default
  facets.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_FIELDS`: List of fields (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  field will be created by default. Caution: some default fields are required by
  Kerko or by badges. If required fields are excluded, the application will
  probably not start. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_fields()` for the list of default
  fields. Note that if `kerko.search.fulltext` is `False`, the `'text_docs'`
  field, which otherwise would contain the full-text, is excluded by default.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_SCOPES`: List of scopes (identified by key) to
  exclude from those created by default. If that list contains the value '*', no
  scope will be added by default. Caution: most default fields are expecting one
  or more of those scopes to exist. If required scopes are excluded, the
  application will probably not start. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_scopes()` for the list of default
  scopes. Note that if `kerko.search.fulltext` is `False`, the `'metadata'` ("In
  all fields") and `'fulltext'` ("In documents") scopes are excluded by default.
- `KERKOAPP_EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_SORTS`: List of sorts (identified by key) to exclude
  from those created by default. Caution: at least one sort must remain for the
  application to start. Please refer to the implementation of
  `kerko.composer.Composer.init_default_sorts()` for the list of default sorts.
- `KERKOAPP_FACET_INITIAL_LIMIT`: Limits the number of facet values initially
  shown on search results pages. If more values are available, a "show more"
  button will let the user expand the list. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no limit).
- `KERKOAPP_FACET_INITIAL_LIMIT_LEEWAY`: If the number of facet values exceeds
  `KERKOAPP_FACET_INITIAL_LIMIT` by this tolerance margin or less, all values
  will be initially shown. Defaults to `0` (i.e. no tolerance margin).
- `KERKOAPP_MIME_TYPES`: List of allowed MIME types for attachments. Defaults to
  `"application/pdf"`.
- `KERKOAPP_ITEM_EXCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to exclude items based on their tags.
  Any object that have a tag that matches this regular expression will be
  excluded. If empty (which is the default), no items will be excluded unless
  `KERKOAPP_ITEM_INCLUDE_RE` is set, in which case items that do not have any
  tag that matches it will be excluded.
- `KERKOAPP_ITEM_INCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to include items based on their tags.
  Any item which does not have a tag that matches this regular expression will
  be ignored. If this value is empty (which is the default), all items will be
  accepted unless `KERKOAPP_ITEM_EXCLUDE_RE` is set which can cause some items
  to be rejected.
- `KERKOAPP_TAG_EXCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to exclude tags. The default value
  causes any tag that begins with an underscore ('_') to be ignored by Kerko.
  Note that record exports (downloads) always include all tags regardless of
  this parameter, which only applies to information displayed by Kerko (exports
  are generated by the Zotero API, not by Kerko).
- `KERKOAPP_TAG_INCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to include tags. By default, all tags
  are accepted. Note that record exports (downloads) always include all tags
  regardless of this parameter, which only applies to information displayed by
  Kerko (exports are generated by the Zotero API, not by Kerko).
- `KERKOAPP_CHILD_EXCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to exclude children (e.g. notes,
  attachments) based on their tags. Any child that have a tag that matches this
  regular expression will be ignored. If empty, no children will be rejected
  unless `KERKOAPP_CHILD_INCLUDE_RE` is set and the tags of those children do
  not match it. By default, any child having at least one tag that begins with
  an underscore ('_') is rejected.
- `KERKOAPP_CHILD_INCLUDE_RE`: Regex to use to include children (e.g. notes,
  attachments) based on their tags. Any child which does not have a tag that
  matches this regular expression will be ignored. If this value is empty (which
  is the default), all children will be accepted unless
  `KERKOAPP_CHILD_EXCLUDE_RE` is set and causes some to be rejected.
- `LOGGING_LEVEL`: Severity of events to track. Allowed values are `DEBUG`,
  `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Defaults to `DEBUG` if app is running
  in debug mode, and to `WARNING` otherwise.

Note that some of Kerko's variables do not have a corresponding environment
variable in KerkoApp and therefore can only be set in Python from a custom
application.

If you are building your own application, you do not really need the above
environment variables. Instead, you could directly set Kerko variables in your
application's `Config` object and set arguments to `kerko.composer.Composer`'s
init method. In that case, please refer to [Kerko's documentation][Kerko] rather
than KerkoApp's.
