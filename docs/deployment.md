# Deployment

As there are many different operating systems and hosting environments, it is
hard to provide precise and universal instructions for setting up KerkoApp for
use in production.

The procedure will be similar to that of any Flask application, and there are
many guides on the web covering this topic for different environments.

That said, you may refer to the guide below for step-by-step instructions. Even
if your environment is different from the one this guide was designed for, it
might provide you with some useful hints.
