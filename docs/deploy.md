# Deploying in production

As there are many different operating systems and hosting environments,
providing precise and universal instructions for setting up KerkoApp for use in
production is next to impossible.

The procedure will be similar to that of any Flask application, and there are
many guides on the web covering this topic for different environments. Of course
you will still have to deal with the features and configuration methods that are
specific to KerkoApp, and need to configure a scheduler so that your data gets
regularly synchronized from zotero.org.

That said, you may refer to the guide below for step-by-step instructions. Even
if your hosting environment is different from the one this guide was designed
for, it might provide you with some useful hints.
