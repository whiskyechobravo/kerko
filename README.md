# Kerko

[Kerko] is a web application component that provides a user-friendly search and
browsing interface for sharing a bibliography managed with the [Zotero]
reference manager.

The combination of Kerko and Zotero gives you the best of both worlds: a rich
but easy to use web interface for end-users of the bibliography, and a
well-established and powerful bibliographic reference management tool for
individuals or teams working on the bibliography's content.
